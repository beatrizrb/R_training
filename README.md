# R_training

Hello! This is my repo for my training in R. Feel free to explore my learning journey and I hope it may contribute to yours as well!

This repo is published with gitpages, so we can view our R notebooks in a more gracious manner. Take a look at it here: [link](https://brbergamo.github.io/R_training/)
