# Like we Brazilians like to say: anytime is a good time for coffee (even at night)
Yes, Brazilians are obsessed over coffee. But we are alone in this, so is the whole world.
Did you know that besides from water, coffee is the most consumed drink in the world?
Well, let's start our data exploring.
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```
# Scenario
First let's imagine you are about to open your new coffeshop, LateCoffes. Congratulations! You definitely are very busy as opening a store is never an easy task. Right now, you a huge decision to make that choosing which coffees you are going to sell in your shop. Let's say you decide to start with 3 brands. But how are you going to make the decision from which coffee seller to buy?

I believe we could start by analyzing:
- countries of origin of the coffee;
- total cup points of the coffee.

Then my first question is:
- from which country should I buy coffee?

Alright, now that we have decided our criteria, let's import some data, shall we?

## Importing our data
```{r}
library(tidytuesdayR)
data <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2020, week = 28)
coffee_data <- data$coffee_ratings
head(coffee_data)
```
This dataset is huge! How many variables do we have here?
```{r}
dim(coffee_data)
```
Wow! So we have 43 variables and 1339 entries. We surely can have some fun exploring this dataset. But let's select some interesting variables.
What are the variables names?

```{r}
names(coffee_data)
```

### Selecting countries that have at least 10 occurrences in our df
```{r}
filtered_df <- coffee_data %>%
  group_by(country_of_origin) %>%
  filter(n()>=20)

filtered_df

```
We have several producers from different countries with their total cup points data. How can we make a decision which country has the better coffee overall? 

My priority as a coffee shop owner is to have a good and a quality uniform coffee, in the way that my customers are going to have the same good regular experience when drinking my coffee. That is way I will filter my data to select the 15th countries with the lowest standard deviation on total cup points, as their data will be more homogeneous.
```{r}
grouped_df <- aggregate(total_cup_points ~ country_of_origin, filtered_df, sd)
# ordenando e pegando os menores sd
sorted_grouped_df <- grouped_df[order(grouped_df$total_cup_points),]
top15 <- head(sorted_grouped_df, 10)
# fazendo um vetor com os nomes da coluna de country_of_origin
top15_names <- top15$country_of_origin
filteredf2 <- filtered_df %>% filter(country_of_origin %in% top15_names)
filteredf2
```
### Let's take a look at the distribution of these countries

```{r}
p <- ggplot(filteredf2, aes(x=country_of_origin, y=total_cup_points, fill=country_of_origin)) + geom_boxplot() + stat_summary(fun.y=mean, geom="point", shape=20, size=3, color="green", fill="green") + theme(axis.text.x = element_blank() )
  
p
```
Top3 countries with lowests sd: Brazil, China and Colombia







Actually I want to select the top15 countries with thwe lowest standard deviation as I want a more homogenous dataset.


```{r}
median_agg <- aggregate(total_cup_points ~ country_of_origin, filtered_df1, median)
head(median_agg[order(median_agg$total_cup_points),], 15)$country_of_origin
```

```{r}
p <- ggplot(filteredf2, aes(x=country_of_origin, y=total_cup_points, fill=country_of_origin)) + geom_violin() + 
  theme(axis.title.x=element_blank(),
        axis.text.x=element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x=element_blank())

p
```
```{r}
p <- ggplot(filteredf2, aes(x=country_of_origin, y=total_cup_points, fill=country_of_origin)) + geom_boxplot() +
    stat_summary(fun.y=mean, geom="point", shape=20, size=3, color="red", fill="red")
    
p
```




But let's begin by putting our descriptive statistical skills in practice first.

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
